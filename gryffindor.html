      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the four Hogwarts houses,
      Gryffindor was founded by <b><i>Godric Gryffindor</i></b> and favoured
      students who possessed characteristics such as courage, bravery and
      determination. The house colours were scarlet and gold, and the emblematic
      animal was a lion, which decorated the walls of the Gryffindor common
      room. Gryffindor alumni included all seven Weasley children, Harry Potter,
      Hermione Granger, all four Marauders and Albus Dumbledore. Gryffindor
      students embraced a long held rivalry with Slytherin house although they
      were largely friendly with Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students.
