        The boy who lived after the fight with he-who-must-not-be-named. Harry
        Potter was prophesied to be the downfall of Lord Voldemort and therefore
        singled out at birth as the Dark Lord's rival. He was known in the
        wizarding world as 'The Boy Who Lived' after becoming the only known
        survivor of the Killing Curse, which was attempted by Voldemort when
        Harry was just a baby, after both his parents were murdered. But despite
        causing one of the most famous wizarding world events, Harry did not
        know he was a wizard until his eleventh birthday, due to his Muggle aunt
        and uncle neglecting to tell him. He would eventually go on to Hogwarts,
        discover his magical potential, and embark upon several great adventures
        with his best friends, Ron and Hermione.
