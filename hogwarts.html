    <h2>The Founding of Hogwarts:</h2>
    <p>
      Hogwarts was founded in the 10th century by four of the most powerful
      and respected witches and wizards of their time: Godric Gryffindor,
      Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They each had
      their own vision of the type of students they wanted to educate and
      created the four houses of Hogwartsâ€”Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw,
      and Slytherin. While Gryffindor valued bravery and courage, Hufflepuff
      embraced loyalty and hard work. Ravenclaw sought out intelligence and
      wisdom, whereas Slytherin preferred students with ambition and cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The founders worked together in harmony for many years, but conflicts
      eventually arose, particularly between Salazar Slytherin and the others.
      Slytherin believed that only pure-blood wizards should be admitted to
      the school, while the others disagreed, believing magical ability was
      more important than blood status. This disagreement led Slytherin to
      leave the school.
