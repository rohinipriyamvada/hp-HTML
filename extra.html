        <h3>Sorting Hat:</h3>
        <p style="float: left; width: 1000px; padding: 10px">
          Created by the four founders, the hat was enchanted to determine which
          house best suits each student. When a new student arrives at Hogwarts,
          the Sorting Hat is placed on their head, and after assessing their
          personality, qualities, and potential, it assigns them to Gryffindor,
          Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. The Sorting Hat is not just an
          ordinary hat; it possesses intelligence and the ability to speak. It
          even composes and sings a new song each year at the Sorting Ceremony,
          offering insights into the history and values of each house. The hat
          considers the student’s personal traits, but in some cases, it also
          takes their preferences into account.

        <h3>Quidditch:</h3>
        <p style="float: left; width: 1000px">
          Quidditch is the most popular sport in the wizarding world and a
          beloved tradition at Hogwarts. It is a fast-paced, high-flying game
          played on broomsticks, combining elements of speed, strategy, and
          teamwork. The game is played between two teams of seven players, each
          aiming to score points while defending their own goalposts. The game
          is played with four balls: the Quaffle, the Bludgers, and the Golden
          Snitch. Chasers try to score goals with the Quaffle, Beaters use bats
          to deflect the aggressive Bludgers, the Keeper guards the goalposts,
          and the Seeker's task is to catch the Golden Snitch, which earns their
          team 150 points and usually ends the game. The fast-moving Snitch
          makes the Seeker’s role crucial, often determining the outcome of the
          match.

        <h3>The Forbidden forest: A place of mystery and danger</h3>
        <p style="float: left; width: 1000px">
          **Students are strictly prohibited from entering the forbidden
          forest.**
          <br />
          The Forbidden Forest, located on the outskirts of Hogwarts, is a vast,
          dark, and eerie woodland that is strictly off-limits to students
          unless accompanied by a teacher. It is home to a variety of magical
          creatures, some friendly and others highly dangerous. Among its
          inhabitants are centaurs, giant spiders like Aragog and his colony,
          unicorns, thestrals, and even werewolves. The forest is also rumored
          to be a hiding place for dark magic and has witnessed many significant
          events in wizarding history.

        <h3>Proper use of magic:</h3>
        <p style="float: left; width: 1000px">
          Any use of magic outside hogwarts is not allowed unless it is
          necessary. The International Statute of Secrecy, established in 1692,
          strictly forbids the use of magic in the presence of Muggles to
          protect the wizarding world from exposure. This rule ensures that
          magical society remains hidden and prevents chaos or fear among
          non-magical people. The Ministry of Magic enforces this law, and
          violations can result in serious consequences, including warnings,
          fines, or even expulsion from institution. Young witches and wizards
          under the age of 17 are especially monitored through the Trace, a
          magical detection system that alerts the Ministry if magic is
          performed outside of school. However, exceptions exist, such as
          self-defense or emergencies. This law plays a significant role in
          maintaining harmony between the magical and non-magical worlds,
          ensuring that wizards live discreetly while preserving their
          traditions and safety. The secrecy surrounding magic is a fundamental
          aspect of wizarding life, shaping the interactions between the two
          worlds throughout history.
