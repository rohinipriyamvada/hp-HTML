        <h2>Welcome to Hogwarts!</h2>
        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is one of the most renowned
        magical institutions in the wizarding world. Established over a thousand
        years ago, Hogwarts has stood as a beacon of magical education, shaping
        generations of witches and wizards. Its rich history is intertwined with
        the stories of its founders, the houses they created, and the many
        legendary events that have occurred within its walls. The school is
        divided into four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
        Slytherin. Founders: Godric Gryffindor founded Gryffindor, Helga
        Hufflepuff founded Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw founded Ravenclaw, and
        Salazar Slytherin founded Slytherin.Each house has its own noble history
        and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards.

        <h3>Sorting Hat</h3>
        <p style="float: left; width: 1000px">
          Created by the four founders, the hat was enchanted to determine which
          house best suits each student. When a new student arrives at Hogwarts,
          the Sorting Hat is placed on their head, and after assessing their
          personality, qualities, and potential, it assigns them to Gryffindor,
          Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. The Sorting Hat is not just an
          ordinary hat; it possesses intelligence and the ability to speak. It
          even composes and sings a new song each year at the Sorting Ceremony,
          offering insights into the history and values of each house. The hat
          considers the student’s personal traits, but in some cases, it also
          takes their preferences into account.

        <h3>Quidditch</h3>
        <p style="float: left; width: 1000px">
          Quidditch is the most popular sport in the wizarding world and a
          beloved tradition at Hogwarts. It is a fast-paced, high-flying game
          played on broomsticks, combining elements of speed, strategy, and
          teamwork. The game is played between two teams of seven players, each
          aiming to score points while defending their own goalposts. The game
          is played with four balls: the Quaffle, the Bludgers, and the Golden
          Snitch. Chasers try to score goals with the Quaffle, Beaters use bats
          to deflect the aggressive Bludgers, the Keeper guards the goalposts,
          and the Seeker's task is to catch the Golden Snitch, which earns their
          team 150 points and usually ends the game. The fast-moving Snitch
          makes the Seeker’s role crucial, often determining the outcome of the
          match.

      <h3>The Forbidden forest: A place of mystery and danger</h3>
      <p style="float: left; width: 1000px">
        **Students are strictly prohibited from entering the forbidden forest.**
        <br />
        The Forbidden Forest, located on the outskirts of Hogwarts, is a vast,
        dark, and eerie woodland that is strictly off-limits to students unless
        accompanied by a teacher. It is home to a variety of magical creatures,
        some friendly and others highly dangerous. Among its inhabitants are
        centaurs, giant spiders like Aragog and his colony, unicorns, thestrals,
        and even werewolves. The forest is also rumored to be a hiding place for
        dark magic and has witnessed many significant events in wizarding
        history.

      <p style="float: left; width: 1000px">
        Any use of magic outside hogwarts is not allowed unless it is necessary.
        The International Statute of Secrecy, established in 1692, strictly
        forbids the use of magic in the presence of Muggles to protect the
        wizarding world from exposure. This rule ensures that magical society
        remains hidden and prevents chaos or fear among non-magical people. The
        Ministry of Magic enforces this law, and violations can result in
        serious consequences, including warnings, fines, or even expulsion from
        institution. Young witches and wizards under the age of 17 are
        especially monitored through the Trace, a magical detection system that
        alerts the Ministry if magic is performed outside of school. However,
        exceptions exist, such as self-defense or emergencies. This law plays a
        significant role in maintaining harmony between the magical and
        non-magical worlds, ensuring that wizards live discreetly while
        preserving their traditions and safety. The secrecy surrounding magic is
        a fundamental aspect of wizarding life, shaping the interactions between
        the two worlds throughout history.
