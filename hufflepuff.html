      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the four founders of Hogwarts
      School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, <i>Helga Hufflepuff</i> favoured
      students who were 'just and loyal.' Fairness was at the heart of
      Hufflepuff house, and as a result, had arguably the most inclusive and
      open approach to accepting students from all backgrounds and of all
      talents. As a witch, Helga had been talented at charms and enjoyed eating
      and preparing feasts. Indeed, many of her recipes were still used in the
      Hogwarts kitchens centuries after her death.
