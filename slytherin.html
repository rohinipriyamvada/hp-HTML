      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Salazar Slytherin</i> was one of
      the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the
      least open to the idea of non-magical families sending their children to
      the school. Slytherin was a talented wizard, and skilled in Parseltongue
      and Legilimency, who favoured students in particular who showed signs of
      cunning and ambition. As he became more obsessed with the idea of magical
      purity, he grew away from his fellow founders and was eventually cast out
      of the school - but not before he was able to hide a dark secret within
      the walls of the castle. Salazar's dark legacy (and several of his
      possessions) would pass down his family, such as his locket and ring.
