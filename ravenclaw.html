      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A founder of Hogwarts School of
      Witchcraft and Wizardry, <i>Rowena Ravenclaw</i> was known for her
      brilliant mind and love of learning. Her house encouraged these qualities
      in its students, and as a result, boasted some of the cleverest and
      highest achieving witches and wizards at the school. However, Rowena's
      history was mired in tragedy. Rowena's daughter Helena was murdered after
      stealing her mother's enchanted diadem and running away. Both Helena and
      her murderer, The Bloody Baron, haunted Hogwarts, representing Ravenclaw
      and Slytherin house respectively.
